## About
<p> This is a stock analysis tool which can be used to analyse and compare stocks. It has a dashboard,a compare section using graphs, and a page to add the stocks using their symbols or the company name. Once a stock has been added some general info about that stock is shown in the dashboard along with the stock price of that day and a mini graph of that week's perfomance. If there are multiple stocks and they need to be compared the compare section can be used to view their prices over a longer time period on a chart. It also has an option to hide some of the stocks if you only want some of them. </p>

## How To Use

To clone and run this application, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer. From your command line:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/hyusef/stockmore

# Go into the repository
$ cd stockmore

# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# Run the app
$ npm start
```

## Challenges
* The first challenge i had was using the Alphavantage API. It was very annoying and especially the search endpoint which wasn't very accurate. It also had a limit which would cause errors on certain occasions. I later installed an npm library based on yahoo finance data and it solved all my problems. 

* I also had problems using react query, but the documentation was good and i solved all the problems. This is my first project where i used it and I'm in love with it. It had many features which would take me a long time to do myself. 

* Another problem i had was figuring out how to implement the chart. I tried my best to find a formula that could put all of the different stocks with different ranges in one chart but that didn't work at all. I could not put a stock with a high cost in the same chart as one with a small cost as that would mess up the chart ranges. After alot of trying i found out that i had to use the difference in percentage between the current and the previous day  starting from day 0 and that worked as it deals with increase/decrease in percentages.





## Lessons Learned
* Before doing this project i didn't know much about stocks. Doing this project i was forced to learn more about stocks and i learnt alot. Like the different exchanges like NYSE and NASDAQ, private and public companies, IPO's, organizational structure of companies and many other things. This in and of itself is a lesson which is that coding an app doesn't just teach you about coding but you'll also learn many different things depending on the app you're making.

* I learnt about how to use react query, i learnt about pagination and how to make requests taking pagination into account, i learnt how to  visualise data using chartjs among other things.

## Improvements

* I don't think the first thing a user should see is text informing them that their dashboard is empty. I would therefore like to change that.
* The code is not as clear as it should be. I want to add some comments to explain the less clear parts.
* The reloading after adding a stock is unnecessary. Need to implement some sort of cache.
